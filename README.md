## Project Description
A video project management dashboard with upload functionality.

- **Responsive Design**: Modern UI that works on desktop and mobile devices

## Upload Functionality
The upload button supports three methods:
1. **Local Desktop**: Select and upload video files directly from your computer
2. **Google Drive**: Upload videos from your Google Drive (requires API setup)
3. **OneDrive**: Upload videos from your OneDrive (requires API setup)

## Files
- `index.html` - Entry point (redirects to login)
- `login.html` - Login/landing page
- `login.js` - Login authentication logic
- `Vugru HTML.html` - Main dashboard HTML structure
- `Vugru CSS.css` - Styling and layout
- `Vugru JS.js` - Interactive functionality and upload logic

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` or `login.html` in a web browser
2. Login with your credentials (see Demo Credentials below)
3. Access the dashboard after successful authentication

## Demo Credentials
For testing purposes, you can use any email and password (minimum 3 characters), or use these predefined credentials:
- Email: `demo@vugru.com` / Password: `demo123`
- Email: `admin@vugru.com` / Password: `admin123`
- Email: `user@example.com` / Password: `password123`
- Email: `test@test.com` / Password: `test123`

**Note:** In production, replace the authentication logic in `login.js` with actual API calls to your backend server.
